          Track events happening in Gainesville (e.g., farmer's markets, concerts etc.), create itineraries, and share experiences.
          Our application includes features like weather forecasts, location/preference based recommendations and daily itineraries,
          interactive map feature, reviews, ratings and comments for events. Users can form groups, interact with each other and
          discover similar interests. Users may also manually post their own events for others to join in/sign up for. The application
          provides real-time notifications about new events or any changes made to existing events. Suggestions on transit are also
          provided to give users the optimal way to get to where they need to go depending on distance, cost and parking availability.
