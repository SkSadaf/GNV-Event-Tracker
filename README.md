# GNV-Event-Tracker

# Project description
This project is for CEN5035(Software Engineering). It is an application where users can track events happening in Gainesville (e.g., farmerâ€™s markets, concerts etc.), create itineraries, and share experiences. It includes features like weather forecasts, location/preference based recommendations and daily itineraries, interactive map feature, reviews, ratings and comments for events.
Users can form groups, interact with each other and discover similar interests.
Users may also manually post their own events for others to join in/sign up for.
The application provides real-time notifications about new events or any changes made to existing events. Suggestions on transit are also provided to give users the optimal way to get to where they need to go depending on distance, cost and parking availability.
