# Sprint 1 Report

## **User Stories**

1. **As a user**, I want to be able to register and login to securely access all the events that I want to attend or have already attended (event history) with 2-factor authentication/verify email.
2. **As a user**, I want to be able to see the details of an event (title, description, location, directions, contact details, reviews, ratings, and comments) so I have a clear idea about the event.
3. **As a user**, I should be able to book event tickets and get details on my email so that I don't have to go to a different site to book the event tickets, get an email/document confirmation, and view them on my dashboard.
4. **As a user**, I want to be able to view my profile details, edit details, and delete my profile as per my requirements.
5. **As a user**, I want to opt out of the event and cancel my booking so that I do not have to go somewhere else to cancel if my plans change and also I get my refund if I had paid for the tickets, along with an email/document confirmation.
6. **As a registered user**, I want to be able to post my own events so that other users can view them and attend.
7. **As a registered user**, I want to be able to add comments to events to talk to other users and find out who else is going.
8. **As a site visitor**, I want to access an interactive map view of the events so that I can clearly understand where in Gainesville such events are taking place.
9. **As a user**, I want to be able to see the tags/categories associated with an event so that I can know what type of event it is.
10. **As a user**, I want to be able to view recommendations of events based on my preferences (previously attended events) so that I can go to events that I am interested in (e.g., event tag-based recommendations, location, category, etc.).
11. **As a user**, I want to be able to view the directions to the event I will be attending so that I can have a clear idea of the destination and how long it will take me to get there. Suggestions on transit are also provided to give users the optimal way to get to where they need to go depending on distance, cost, and parking availability.
12. **As a user**, I want to be able to see the weather conditions of the event location that I will be attending so that I am better prepared (weather forecasts).
13. **As a user**, I want to be able to receive notifications/emails about the events I have registered for so that I can stay as up-to-date as possible on nearby events without having to check the application (about new events or any changes made to existing events).
14. **As a registered user**, I want to be able to form private groups with other users to chat about upcoming events and connect with them.
15. **As a user**, I want to be able to indicate if I’m planning on going to an event to let my friends know that I will be attending. For those I’m not friends with, this will also just add to the total number of people attending the event so myself and all other users can see how many people plan on going.
16. **As a user**, I want to be able to create daily/weekly itineraries based on my event schedule so that I can plan my day/week accordingly.
17. **As a user**, I can reset/change my password with a link if I forget it or want to update, and my credentials should be updated.

## **Which ones didn’t and why?**

All issues our frontend and backend teams addressed for Sprint 1 were successfully completed. We considered implementing a Google account API for login/registration, but decided to implement more rudimentary login/registration API functions for now, leaving that issue for a later date.
